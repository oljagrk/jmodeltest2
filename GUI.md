# Graphical User Interface #



## Launching the Graphical User Interface ##

The main distribution includes a script for launching the interface,  _**runjmodeltest-gui.sh**_, located under the jModelTest home folder.

Other possibility is running the following command line:
```
$ java -jar jModelTest.jar
```

Moreover, in Windows and MacOS X, it is often possible to double-click the jModelTest.jar file to launch the graphical interface.

The following window will show on the screen:
