# How To Download #

Google Code downloads are no longer available, and this service has been replaced by Google Drive. Click the [jModelTest Downloads](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByrkKOPtF_n_OUs3d0dNcnJPYXM#list) link and it will take you to the Google Drive shared folder with the jModelTest files.

The latest distribution is located right in the main folder:

  * **jmodeltest-2.1.x-_revnumber_.tar.gz**  Full distribution including PhyML binaries
  * **jmodeltest-2.1.x-_revnumber_-upgrade.tar.gz**  Only the necessary files  for upgrading jModelTest2 if you already have the previous revision installed. Note that this might not work if you are trying to update a very old version. In that case, I would suggest to download the full distribution.
  * **jmodeltest-2.1.x-manual.pdf** Complete manual in pdf format.
  * **`OldRevisions`/** Older jModelTest2 distributions

_revnumber_ is the revision identifier. It is the date that revision was released, having the format yyyymmdd (year - month - day).

Once you click in the file you want to download, the file information will come to the foreground.
